Ethics of Web Scraping

Based on lawsuits, We need to have an idea of what is legal and what is not legal when it comes to web scraping. In some cases, if one commercializes the data from a website then the website owner might sue them and end up losing in the lawsuit.

In the sense of web scraping a website data, the law actually allowed to scrap data as long as you think about a couple of things.

1.Check for copyright, if not then probably legal for scrap data.
2.Check the data is not behind authentication, if yes then we agree not to use the data that we obtained on the website.
3.Go for public API first
4.Limit the rate of scraping frequency, so that the website potentially does not make the website go down and it affects other users using the website.
5.Look for legal jargon provided by the website owner, we can see allows and disallows scraping data.
